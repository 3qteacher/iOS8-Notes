After hitting *next* and choosing a project location Xcode will create the new project, based on a project template. You will see that the template contains, among additoinal files, an `AppDelegate` class, a `ViewController` class and a `Main.storyboard` file:

#Configuring the Storyboard

We want to create an App that can display notes. The app will consist of two different View Controllers, the first one will display a list of notes, the second one will display the details of a note when it is selected from the list. We will design the entire layout of this app in Storyboard. Open the `Main.storyboard` file to get started.

##Setting up the NotesListViewController

Let's start by creating the first View Controller that displays a list of notes. Whenever we want to display items in a list on iOS we use a component called `UITableView`. Since that component is used very often Interface Builder provides a template View Controller called "Table View Contoller" that provides a basic table view and a ViewController that is associated with it. Before we create it let's remove the default View Controller that has been created as part of the template:

- Select the View Controller in the Storyboard by clicking into it and hit the delete key
- Remove the `ViewController` class from Xcode (Selectn "Move to Trash" when prompt appears)

Now your Xcode project should look like this:
